# ITC Asset Management System
An asset management system design to log, monitor, and manage a network of electrical transformers & transformer failures. 

Developed for the MISSA ITC conference. For more information, [visit their website here](https://www.calpolymissa.org/html/itc.html) 

## Features
- #### Table log of all previous transformer failures, along with their specifications
  - Sorting, filtering, and pagination features for tables to enhance user experience.
- #### User-friendly form for logging new transformer failures
  - Built-in authentication protects transformer database from being tampered by unauthorized individuals.
- #### Analytics insight page on various statistics for previous transformer failures
  - Analytics-based predictions using various classification & clustering machine learning models

## Technologies
The entire technology stack is built upon Python and its various libraries. 

Python was chosen due to its simple syntax and ubiquity in the IT automation and data analytics space. It will allow developers from multiple fields to easily collaborate without having to learn a new programming language.
